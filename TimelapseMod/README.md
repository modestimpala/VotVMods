# Timelapse Mod - Multi-cam Time/Hyperlapse Camera System

This mod implements a camera system into VotV for content creators to make Timelapse and Hyperlapse sequences. You can spawn multiple cameras, reposition them easily, and record different angles simultaneously!

Note: This mod can easily create noticeable overhead and can likely cause frame drops when capturing many high resolution cameras. This only happens upon capturing the Timelapse Cameras, ie, every 60 seconds. To avoid this, lower your timelapse resolution or limit number of cameras (or just deal with it, since you're making a cool video)

Timelapse Images are stored at VotV\Timelapse\cam#\ in .png format.

### Features:
 - Multi-Camera Support
 - Finely Reposition Cameras via Pawn Movement
 - Add movement to Cameras after Capture to create dynamic Hyperlapse videos 
 - Configurable Capture Settings
 - Save and Load Camera Positions and Settings

##

To get started, click the settings button (cog wheels) and configure your desired capture interval, camera FOV, and capture resolution.

Then, click Spawn Camera to create a Timelapse Camera. You can reposition the camera easily by clicking the Move Last Camera button which will possess the camera and allow fine repositioning.

When repositioning a Camera, press ESC to return to Main Player. You can also press Q to add a directional vector to apply to the Camera after it captures a picture, which will move the Camera in a certain direction after capturing, creating dynamic Hyperlapse like videos.  

You can create any number of cameras at many different angles and the Timelapse Mod will record all of them simultaneously. 

When you are satisfied with your camera placements and movement options, you can press the Save Icon to save all camera positions and settings, and reload them whenever needed. This will save positions even after moving from Capture Movement settings allowing seamless pickup from previous recording sessions. 

When ready to record, press the Toggle Recording button. The UI will show "Rec" when recording. The cameras will capture images repeatedly based on your configured Capture Interval. The images are then saved to VotV\Timelapse\cam#\ as a PNG file. You can then use an editing program to stitch these images together to create Timelapse videos of gameplay and cinematic scenes.
