This mod adds an entire fully functional Slot Machine to the Store for purchase.

Features:
 - Multiple different payouts
 - Bonus, free spin and wildcard symbols
 - Articulating spin lever
 - Funny Mode (find the funny button)

Current Limitations: 
 - Shop order arrives as a cube, not sure why, since I'm creating it exactly like my SpinnyChairs mod
 - Points deposited are not saved in between sessions, be sure to cash out when done
 
Art including model, textures, and symbols are subject to change - I think it's fine for now but I'm not completely happy with it.

 Paytable:
